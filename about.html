        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>
            My interests for computers began here, on the internet when I learnt how to create simple HTML page and hosted it on my home computer. At the time it felt like a major accomplishment although the design was unappealing and had no functionality it got me fascinated with the idea that something could be made with just a few lines of code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, my desire to learn more about this ever-expanding subject has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with many of the prominent technologies used by both hobbyists and organizations. Furthermore, my resilience to "getting things to work" has enabled me to improve my problem-solving abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deploying web applications and experimenting with open-source software such as Apache and MySQL on Linux servers used by businesses have given me an outlook on how systems are managed. I am also an open-source enthusiast having started a few projects on GitHub. Python, JavaScript, C, and Shell are the languages and frameworks that I have utilised in my projects.
        </p>        
        <p>
            I also like to tinker with microcontrollers, electronics, and single-board computers. I feel the applications for these devices to be endless. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I prefer to keep learning and challenge myself with new obstacles. Although I’m just beginning my career journey, I am Excited for the advancements that will be made in the field of computer science and I Hope I can contribute.

                        <p>"Principles of Computer Science” along with “Fundamentals of Computer Systems” was one of the key modules of this Course and was essential an introduction to the world of computing.</p>
                        <p>For “Planning and Management of Computing Projects” we learned the fundamentals of managing software projects, further expanding into the “Systems Methodology” we learned the practical side of things. The assignment document can be viewed here.</p>
                        <p>“Software Design and Development Project” was an exciting module as we learned to program in python. Furthermore, we were graded based on out capability of coding a project assigned to us without the use of the internet.</p>
                        <p>“IT Systems Security and Encryption” taught us the importance of security and the standard practices used by originations to secure their systems. Moreover, we learned about encryption, access control, network controls and worked with Linux systems. </p>
                        <p>“Business Applications of social media” taught me the importance of social media in Business and how to have a successful presence online.</p>
                        <p>For the “The Impact of Computing” module we learned about drones, robots, and their impact on society. The assignment document can be accessed here.</p>
                        <p>We also learned to design UI and UX in the “Human-computer Interaction” module </p>
                        <p>For “Computer Games Development” we made a simple game in Visual basic however I opted to use JavaScript for the final coursework. The game can be accessed here. </p>
                        <p>For the “Website Development” we learned HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript and had to create a website using it. Additionally, we used a MySQL database to connect to the website, which was taught in the “Relational Database Development” module. the assignment document for Relational Database Development be viewed here.</p>

          <h4>About this Website</h4>
          <p>This website was built by me mainly using <b>HTML5, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript</b>. However, <b>CSS</b> was also used for some of the styling. The site is static and hosted on <b>GitHub pages</b>. And so are some of the projects that are available to be viewed live. For the particle effect on the index pages background <b>particle.js</b> module was used with a tiny bit of customizations. Most of the stuff is sourced/based on <b>CDN</b> to minimise the files I had to use in my repo. The contact me form uses <b>FormSpree</b> and is linked to my emails however I might change this in the future. No user data is stored besides if a message is sent via the “Contact Me” form. </p>
          <p>Also The source code for this entire website is visible on <a href="https://github.com/ru4en/ru4en.github.io">GitHub</a>.</p>
