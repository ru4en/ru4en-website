        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>
            My interests for computers began here, on the internet when I learnt how to create simple HTML page and hosted it on my home computer. At the time it felt like a major accomplishment although the design was unappealing and had no functionality it got me fascinated with the idea that something could be made with just a few lines of code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, my desire to learn more about this ever-expanding subject has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with many of the prominent technologies used by both hobbyists and organizations. Furthermore, my resilience to "getting things to work" has enabled me to improve my problem-solving abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deploying web applications and experimenting with open-source software such as Apache and MySQL on Linux servers used by businesses have given me an outlook on how systems are managed. I am also an open-source enthusiast having started a few projects on GitHub. Python, JavaScript, C, and Shell are the languages and frameworks that I have utilised in my projects.
        </p>        
        <p>
            I also like to tinker with microcontrollers, electronics, and single-board computers. I feel the applications for these devices to be endless. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I prefer to keep learning and challenge myself with new obstacles. Although Iâ€™m just beginning my career journey, I am Excited for the advancements that will be made in the field of computer science and I Hope I can contribute.
